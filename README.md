# Perceptual Trainer
 Perceptual Trainer was the product of my graduation research and thesis on using serious games or gamification and digital technology to help train fingerprint experts. My solution, Perceptual Trainer, utilises gamification to train complete beginners on the fundamentals of fingerprint examination with a focus on perceptual expertise rather than on theoretical work.  â€‹  Perceptual Trainer offers practical coursework to learners focusing on identifying fingerprint patterns and features that provide the foundation to working with ACE-V. Gamification is utilised to help engage learners and improve the learning process by implementing features such as a score system, achievements, and difficulty levels.
